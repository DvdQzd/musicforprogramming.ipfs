# musicForProgramming("IPFS!");

This is a port of [musicForProgramming.net][mfp] remade with [Svelte][svelte]
and aimed to be hosted with [IPFS][ipfs].

Most of the content in this repository are the result of
[Datassette's][datassette] hard work. All love goes to Datassette and the
contributors to [musicForProgramming.net][mfp] for making such a wonderful site
that I've had so many hours of great use from. ‚ù§
