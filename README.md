# musicForProgramming("IPFS!");

Listen to music while you program, streamed via the peer-to-peer technology [IPFS][ipfs]. The music comes from [musicforprogramming.net][mfp], and has been carefully chosen to maximize concentration by providing just the right amount of interest to occupy the parts of your brain that would otherwise be left free to wander and lead to distraction during your work.

> This web page was stumbled together by [@jilleJr](https://github.com/jilleJr) in Visual Studio Code. It is a dApp port of the wonderful [musicforprogramming.net][mfp], rewritten in [Svelte][svelte] in the plan of hosting it [IPFS][ipfs].
>
> This site was _originally_ knocked together by [Datassette][datassette] in SublimeText. Episodes are faffed with using iZotope Ozone and Adobe Audition to maintain comparable loudness and frequency presence between episodes.

### Seeding peers

Adding known seeding peers will speed up the dApp as that gives your local IPFS node a known place to download the files from.

Multiaddresses of peers:

```multiaddr
/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWLzTuiZtMJDFzJuGQ2mob5ySC3wY2EndGhitrCV5RQ7BC
```

- If you're using the [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion) browser extension or the [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop) app

  - Open the control panel UI and enter the "PEERS" tab from the left sidenav.
  - Then click <kbd>+ Add connection</kbd> and paste a peer multiaddress from above.

- If you're using the [IPFS CLI](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)

  - Run the following command:

    ```console
    $ ipfs swarm connect /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWLzTuiZtMJDFzJuGQ2mob5ySC3wY2EndGhitrCV5RQ7BC
    connect 12D3KooWLzTuiZtMJDFzJuGQ2mob5ySC3wY2EndGhitrCV5RQ7BC success
    ```

- _ok that's probably enough alternatives..._

## Why does this repo exist

1. I wanted to try developing with Svelte
2. I wanted to try publishing to IPFS
3. I want to use more dApps in everyday life, and this is a :100: everyday app for me

### Difference with [musicforprogramming.net][mfp]

|                    | This repo                | [musicforprogramming.net][mfp] |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Hosting            | [IPFS][ipfs] (over HTTP) | HTTP                           |
| Backend            | None (static site)       | PHP (I'm guessing?)            |
| Frontend framework | [Svelte][svelte]         | [jQuery][jquery]               |
| Originality        | _Barely any_             | _Tons_                         |

## Development

### Setting up dev env

1. Install [Node.js][node-dl] (v14 or greater) and download all code
   dependencies using `npm`:

   ```console
   $ npm install
   ```

2. Download all music files. It's about 6 GB of .mp3 files, so hosting them in
   the repo is unfeasible, even with Git LFS.

   Easiest way is to install [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and download
   via <https://musicforprogramming.net/MFP_01-52.torrent>. That only provides
   the songs 01 to 52, so songs 53 to 62 will have to be downloaded manually
   from the webpage <https://musicforprogramming.net/>.

   Place the downloaded songs in `public/audio/*.mp3`.

### Serve local files

Serve code locally with live reloading on code change:

```console
$ npm run dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:5000/>.
